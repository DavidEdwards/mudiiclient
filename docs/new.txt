v1.4.0

Log files are now substantially smaller because the HTML style-sheets are now online.

v1.3.0

Added triggers to set macros for expansion as well as harvesting mausoleum answers from play (e.g. "op se" expands to "op 'answer")
Added anti-aliased fonts and system true type font support. No more ugly letters!
Cleaned up the login code. Now /F will be sent in all cases.
Removed Java WebStart support. This means a less intuitive installation. :( Code signing certificates are fiddly to obtain and require yearly admin and funds to refresh.

v1.2.4

Fix for occassional failure to correctly resize the scroll bar when you first enter the Land.
Fixed tiny scrollback size limit introduced in v1.2.3. 

v1.2.3

No longer scrape stats from snooped text. This was causing confusion when someone you were snooping in a fight. Their stamina would overwrite yours on the status bar.
Found and fixed a bug in selecting & copying text.
Fixed the scroll bar position when you press ESC to get out of scroll-back mode.
Cleaned up some code that was long overdue an overhaul. Should have fixed the bizarre text miscolouring problem that cropped up once in a blue moon.
Attempted a fix for grey not showing up. Needs testing (cue the wizzes).

v1.2.2

Status bar will now compact down to a smaller size if the window is small
Installers create shortcuts called "mudiiclient" not "mudiiclient-setup".
Automated generating and uploading the installer.

v1.2.1

fixed bug introduced in v1.2.0: /F was no longer being sent, so word wrap was broken

v1.2.0

Guest login feature added.
Disabled "Quick Keys" and recording commands to history.txt
Updated "How to Use MUDIIClient" document
Login process now clutters the display less (no Rest or Examine commands are sent)
